To run this code locally, you will need to do the following steps:
1. Make sure python is installed.
2. Follow these instructions to setup the Google Cloud Vision API: https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/before-you-begin
3. Clone the repository and navigate to it in your Command Line Terminal.
4. For Mac Users, run "sudo python3 main.py" in your terminal. The program will launch. 

You may need to change the cam_port number in real time reading to match the correct camera you would like to connect to. 

Check "Additional Info" for a video of a working demo and a research paper that outlines the design and development process and next steps! If you'd like to get involved, please reach out to auddin@princeton.edu.

### Future Steps:
- Create the gamification + account stuff
- Create bounding box around the book?
- Create translation 
- Python GUI / Updated UI
